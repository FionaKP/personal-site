## Things I've Learned from this Project 
1. Nothing is all that serious. It doesn't matter that my blog is on one page with nothing but a nav bar and centered text - the point of this is the exercise not the end product.
4. I love doing this kind of stuff. I've known that for a while but I think it is worth reiterating because it makes all the harder stuff so worth it.
5. Everyone's style is different. I've spend SO much time pouring over other people's portfolios but it's okay that mine looks different and isn't complete yet. I'm working on it and that's what matters.

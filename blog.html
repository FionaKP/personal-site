                        <p>Don't you just love it when a project that you've been able to see cleary in your head finally starts becoming a reality? Because that's exactly what I'm feeling right now and its pretty awesome.</p>
                        <p>For a little context: I have been messing with the hero page of this site for longer than I care to admit. A HUGE reason for that is beccause of the way I had the backgroun image. I followed some random tutorial I found because I wanted the photo to fit a certain way and in order to do so I used something like so:</p>
                        <p class="code">&ltimg src="hero.jpg" alt="My Background Image"&gt</p>
                        <p>I obviously did plenty of styling on top of it that I would like to pretend never happened but I'll give you the rundown only if you insist. Basicalyyyyy, I made absolutely everything on the entire page NEED to have a pesky little attribute called... </p>
                        <p class="code">position: absolute;</p>
                        <p>While I'm not going to say that in every case this is a <u>bad</u> thing, however in many I think it does lack a little <i>je ne sais quoi</i> if you will. Rather, it means you could have programmed in a much better and more efficient way, and that's <b>IF</b> you consider HTML and CSS to be programming in the first place.</p>
                        <p style="text-align: center;">I'm not so sure I do. They're just unglorified google docs writing.</p>
                        <p>However, there is a bright side to this story. I found a wonderful little site that if you're here, well, either you're my mom. Hi mom! Or you program at least a little (by that I mean you can google the hell out of anything) and you know a site called <a class="plain-link" target="_blank" href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.php?filename=trycss3_background_hero">https://www.w3schools.com/</a>. Life savers you are W3 Schools, truly.</p>
                        <p>It wasn't that I didn't know there was a background-image property in CSS, it's more that unless I've used something a lot I generally will believe I don't know how to use it then I'll go to the interwebs as a handy dandy lil free guide. Unfortunately that'll lead you astray sometime but alas I digress.</p>
                        <p>When I went to that wonderful little tutorial I got my hero background image squared away in no-time. Thus leaving plenty of time for the upgrades the title of this post so pulled you in about.</p>
                        <h3>SIDE MENUUUUUU</h3>
                        <p>That's right slime. Did I write it in my little todo list the other day. Well I don't remember, you could take a little looksie if you care so much but I've had the idea cooking for a while so it makes me so unreasonably happy that I got that bad boy working. The reason I included that whole preamble bad boy is precisely because my little position absolute oppsie was making it <i>impossible</i> to make the side menu even a fathomable next step.</p>
                        <p>Slime. I'm gonna keep calling you whoever is reading this slime. Like a little love letter but I don't know you and instead of a cute name its slime (but in my head I see a little green slime ball with googley eyes so it's not that I think poorly of you) just a cute little pile of goop, that's all.</p>
                        <p>Anyways, shlime. I hope you think the cute little side-menu bar is as cute as I do you googley-eyed little guy. Have such a wonderful day and I'll catch ya next time!</p>

                        <p>What if I just didn't give any Fs about making this look pretty whatsoever? Like sure somewhat here and there but really nothing besides a little css to put it all in the center and separating the paragraphs when I feel like it.</p> 
                        <p>Like if we are going to be honest, and I will since I can... This blog is for me and only me so I get to just mess around with it. While it isn't meant to be a train wreck I do think there is more value to me as an individual and as someone who is constantly evolving and learning her own style of design to just <u><b>DO</b></u> and not think so much about it all the time.</p>
                        <p>So here's what I am going to do! (Whether you like it or not, I really couldn't care less, you.) I am just going to write them all on one page for now. <span style="color:#E27743; font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold;">RIGHT HERE!!</span> Yep, so literally every single blog post will just go right above this one. How fun and charming!! </p>
                        <p>Here are some of the things that I would love to later on implement:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><s>Add a go back to top button (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_scroll_to_top.asp)</s></li>
                            <li>A "See More..." button that hides and unhides all but the most recent post on this page</li>
                            <li>Separate blog post pages and one central "<i>Heres the start of the blog!</i>" page</li>
                            <li>Make it so that those pages can be previewed (image or title etc.)</li>
                            <li>Using flask and SQL make a function or mini web app so I can type each part into a form of sorts and just click a button and it makes the blog post for me on its own page</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>What can I say? A girl has got big dreams for a blog with a sky blue background and nothing else on it. But you know what I have always spent SOOOOOO much time worrying about making things perfect that I never actually just get to the doing part. And that sucks because the doing is the best part of any project, not the worrying or planning it.</p>
                        <p>For tonight since it is nearly 1am, I am going to call it but this is good and I'll keep making updates. I will also 100% maybe probably but I really should put this on github and figure out how to host it too.</p>
